# Pomodoro Practice App
This project is a work timer application based on the Pomodoro technique. Users can customize settings such as work duration, break duration, and number of rounds, and the application switches between work and break periods based on these settings.

## Pomodoro Practice App
The application starts with a settings page where users can adjust the working duration, break duration, and number of cycles. Users can edit these settings and start the work timer by clicking the "Start" button. The application will run during the duration set by the user, then switch to the break time, and continue in this manner until the specified number of cycles is completed.
